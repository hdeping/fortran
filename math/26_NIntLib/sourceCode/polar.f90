!  subroutine polar fits a smooth function f(x,y) to a set of data
!  points (x(i),y(i),z(i)) scattered arbitrarily over an approximation

!    x = u*rad(v)*cos(v) , y = u*rad(v)*sin(v)
!  the approximation problem is reduced to the determination of a bi-
!  cubic spline s(u,v) fitting a corresponding set of data points
!  (u(i),v(i),z(i)) on the rectangle 0<=u<=1,-pi<=v<=pi.

!  if iopt(1) < 0 circle calculates a weighted least-squares spline
!  according to a given set of knots in u- and v- direction.
!  if iopt(1) >=0, the number of knots in each direction and their pos-
!  ition tu(j),j=1,2,...,nu ; tv(j),j=1,2,...,nv are chosen automatical-
!  ly by the routine. the smoothness of s(u,v) is then achieved by mini-
!  malizing the discontinuity jumps of the derivatives of the spline
!  at the knots. the amount of smoothness of s(u,v) is determined  by
!  the condition that fp = sum((w(i)*(z(i)-s(u(i),v(i))))**2) be <= s,
!  with s a given non-negative constant.
!  the bicubic spline is given in its standard b-spline representation
!  and the corresponding function f(x,y) can be evaluated by means of

!  ier   : integer. unless the routine detects an error, ier contains a
!          non-positive value on exit, i.e.
!   ier=0  : normal return. the spline returned has a residual sum of

!            ive tolerance set to 0.001 by the program.

!   ier<-2 : warning. the coefficients of the spline returned have been
!            computed as the minimal norm least-squares solution of a

!            probably causes : nuest or nvest too small. if these param-

!            the approximation returned is the weighted least-squares

!            the parameter fp gives the corresponding weighted sum of
!            squared residuals (fp>s).
!   ier=2  : error. a theoretically impossible result was found during
!            the iteration proces for finding a smoothing spline with
!            fp = s. probably causes : s too small or badly chosen eps.
!            there is an approximation returned but the corresponding
!            weighted sum of squared residuals does not satisfy the
!            condition abs(fp-s)/s < tol.
!   ier=3  : error. the maximal number of iterations maxit (set to 20
!            by the program) allowed for finding a smoothing spline
!            with fp=s has been reached. probably causes : s too small
!            there is an approximation returned but the corresponding
!            weighted sum of squared residuals does not satisfy the
!            condition abs(fp-s)/s < tol.
!   ier=4  : error. no more knots can be added because the dimension
!            of the spline 1+iopt(2)*(iopt(2)+3)/2+(nv-7)*(nu-5-iopt(2)
!            -iopt(3)) already exceeds the number of data points m.
!            probably causes : either s or m too small.
!            the approximation returned is the weighted least-squares
!            polar spline according to the current set of knots.
!            the parameter fp gives the corresponding weighted sum of
!            squared residuals (fp>s).
!   ier=5  : error. no more knots can be added because the additional
!            knot would (quasi) coincide with an old one.
!            probably causes : s too small or too large a weight to an
!            inaccurate data point.
!            the approximation returned is the weighted least-squares

!            if one of these conditions is found to be violated,control
!            is immediately repassed to the calling program. in that

!   ier>10 : error. lwrk2 is too small, i.e. there is not enough work-
!            space for computing the minimal least-squares solution of
!            a rank deficient system of linear equations. ier gives the
!            requested value for lwrk2. there is no approximation re-
!            turned but, having saved the information contained in nu,
!            nv,tu,tv,wrk1,u,v and having adjusted the value of lwrk2
!            and the dimension of the array wrk2 accordingly, the user
!            can continue at the point the program was left, by calling
!            polar with iopt(1)=1.
!
! further comments:
!  by means of the parameter s, the user can control the tradeoff
!   between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit of the approximation.
!   if s is too large, the spline will be too smooth and signal will be
!   lost ; if s is too small the spline will pick up too much noise. in
!   the extreme cases the program will return an interpolating spline if
!   s=0 and the constrained weighted least-squares polynomial if s is
!   very large. between these extremes, a properly chosen s will result
!   in a good compromise between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit.
!   to decide whether an approximation, corresponding to a certain s is
!   satisfactory the user is highly recommended to inspect the fits
!   graphically.
!   recommended values for s depend on the weights w(i). if these are
!   taken as 1/d(i) with d(i) an estimate of the standard deviation of
!   z(i), a good s-value should be found in the range (m-sqrt(2*m),m+
!   sqrt(2*m)). if nothing is known about the statistical error in z(i)
!   each w(i) can be set equal to one and s determined by trial and
!   error, taking account of the comments above. the best is then to
!   start with a very large value of s ( to determine the least-squares
!   polynomial and the corresponding upper bound fp0 for s) and then to
!   progressively decrease the value of s ( say by a factor 10 in the
!   beginning, i.e. s=fp0/10, fp0/100,...and more carefully as the
!   approximation shows more detail) to obtain closer fits.
!   to choose s very small is strongly discouraged. this considerably
!   increases computation time and memory requirements. it may also
!   cause rank-deficiency (ier<-2) and endager numerical stability.
!   to economize the search for a good s-value the program provides with
!   different modes of computation. at the first call of the routine, or
!   whenever he wants to restart with the initial set of knots the user
!   must set iopt(1)=0.
!   if iopt(1)=1 the program will continue with the set of knots found
!   at the last call of the routine. this will save a lot of computation
!   time if polar is called repeatedly for different values of s.
!   the number of knots of the spline returned and their location will
!   depend on the value of s and on the complexity of the shape of the
!   function underlying the data. if the computation mode iopt(1)=1
!   is used, the knots returned may also depend on the s-values at
!   previous calls (if these were smaller). therefore, if after a number
!   of trials with different s-values and iopt(1)=1,the user can finally
!   accept a fit as satisfactory, it may be worthwhile for him to call
!   polar once more with the selected value for s but now with iopt(1)=0
!   indeed, polar may then return an approximation of the same quality
!   of fit but with fewer knots and therefore better if data reduction
!   is also an important objective for the user.
!   the number of knots may also depend on the upper bounds nuest and
!   nvest. indeed, if at a certain stage in polar the number of knots
!   in one direction (say nu) has reached the value of its upper bound
!   (nuest), then from that moment on all subsequent knots are added
!   in the other (v) direction. this may indicate that the value of
!   nuest is too small. on the other hand, it gives the user the option
!   of limiting the number of knots the routine locates in any direction
