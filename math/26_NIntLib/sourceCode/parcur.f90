      subroutine parcur(iopt,ipar,idim,m,u,mx,x,w,ub,ue,k,s,nest,n,t,
     * nc,c,fp,wrk,lwrk,iwrk,ier)
!  given the ordered set of m points x(i) in the idim-dimensional space
!  and given also a corresponding set of strictly increasing values u(i)
!  and the set of positive numbers w(i),i=1,2,...,m, subroutine parcur
!  determines a smooth approximating spline curve s(u), i.e.
!      x1 = s1(u)
!      x2 = s2(u)       ub <= u <= ue
!      .........
!      xidim = sidim(u)
!  with sj(u),j=1,2,...,idim spline functions of degree k with common
!  knots t(j),j=1,2,...,n.
!  if ipar=1 the values ub,ue and u(i),i=1,2,...,m must be supplied by
!  the user. if ipar=0 these values are chosen automatically by parcur
!  as  v(1) = 0
!      v(i) = v(i-1) + dist(x(i),x(i-1)) ,i=2,3,...,m
!      u(i) = v(i)/v(m) ,i=1,2,...,m
!      ub = u(1) = 0, ue = u(m) = 1.
!  if iopt=-1 parcur calculates the weighted least-squares spline curve
!  according to a given set of knots.
!  if iopt>=0 the number of knots of the splines sj(u) and the position
!  t(j),j=1,2,...,n is chosen automatically by the routine. the smooth-
!  ness of s(u) is then achieved by minimalizing the discontinuity
!  jumps of the k-th derivative of s(u) at the knots t(j),j=k+2,k+3,...,
!  n-k-1. the amount of smoothness is determined by the condition that
!  f(p)=sum((w(i)*dist(x(i),s(u(i))))**2) be <= s, with s a given non-
!  negative constant, called the smoothing factor.
!  the fit s(u) is given in the b-spline representation and can be
!  evaluated by means of subroutine curev.

!    * fp,wrk,lwrk,iwrk,ier)
!
!  parameters:
!   iopt  : integer flag. on entry iopt must specify whether a weighted
!           least-squares spline curve (iopt=-1) or a smoothing spline
!           curve (iopt=0 or 1) must be determined.if iopt=0 the routine
!           will start with an initial set of knots t(i)=ub,t(i+k+1)=ue,
!           i=1,2,...,k+1. if iopt=1 the routine will continue with the
!           knots found at the last call of the routine.
!           attention: a call with iopt=1 must always be immediately
!           preceded by another call with iopt=1 or iopt=0.
!           unchanged on exit.
!   ipar  : integer flag. on entry ipar must specify whether (ipar=1)
!           the user will supply the parameter values u(i),ub and ue
!           or whether (ipar=0) these values are to be calculated by
!           parcur. unchanged on exit.
!   idim  : integer. on entry idim must specify the dimension of the
!           curve. 0 < idim < 11.
!           unchanged on exit.
!   m     : integer. on entry m must specify the number of data points.
!           m > k. unchanged on exit.
!   u     : real array of dimension at least (m). in case ipar=1,before
!           entry, u(i) must be set to the i-th value of the parameter
!           variable u for i=1,2,...,m. these values must then be
!           supplied in strictly ascending order and will be unchanged
!           on exit. in case ipar=0, on exit,array u will contain the
!           values u(i) as determined by parcur.
!   mx    : integer. on entry mx must specify the actual dimension of
!           the array x as declared in the calling (sub)program. mx must
!           not be too small (see x). unchanged on exit.
!   x     : real array of dimension at least idim*m.
!           before entry, x(idim*(i-1)+j) must contain the j-th coord-
!           inate of the i-th data point for i=1,2,...,m and j=1,2,...,
!           idim. unchanged on exit.
!   w     : real array of dimension at least (m). before entry, w(i)
!           must be set to the i-th value in the set of weights. the
!           w(i) must be strictly positive. unchanged on exit.
!           see also further comments.
!   ub,ue : real values. on entry (in case ipar=1) ub and ue must
!           contain the lower and upper bound for the parameter u.
!           ub <=u(1), ue>= u(m). if ipar = 0 these values will
!           automatically be set to 0 and 1 by parcur.
!   k     : integer. on entry k must specify the degree of the splines.
!           1<=k<=5. it is recommended to use cubic splines (k=3).
!           the user is strongly dissuaded from choosing k even,together
!           with a small s-value. unchanged on exit.
!   s     : real.on entry (in case iopt>=0) s must specify the smoothing
!           factor. s >=0. unchanged on exit.
!           for advice on the choice of s see further comments.
!   nest  : integer. on entry nest must contain an over-estimate of the
!           total number of knots of the splines returned, to indicate
!           the storage space available to the routine. nest >=2*k+2.
!           in most practical situation nest=m/2 will be sufficient.
!           always large enough is nest=m+k+1, the number of knots
!           needed for interpolation (s=0). unchanged on exit.
!   n     : integer.
!           unless ier = 10 (in case iopt >=0), n will contain the
!           total number of knots of the smoothing spline curve returned
!           if the computation mode iopt=1 is used this value of n
!           should be left unchanged between subsequent calls.
!           in case iopt=-1, the value of n must be specified on entry.
!   t     : real array of dimension at least (nest).
!           on succesful exit, this array will contain the knots of the
!           spline curve,i.e. the position of the interior knots t(k+2),
!           t(k+3),..,t(n-k-1) as well as the position of the additional
!           t(1)=t(2)=...=t(k+1)=ub and t(n-k)=...=t(n)=ue needed for
!           the b-spline representation.
!           if the computation mode iopt=1 is used, the values of t(1),
!           t(2),...,t(n) should be left unchanged between subsequent
!           calls. if the computation mode iopt=-1 is used, the values
!           t(k+2),...,t(n-k-1) must be supplied by the user, before
!           entry. see also the restrictions (ier=10).
!   nc    : integer. on entry nc must specify the actual dimension of
!           the array c as declared in the calling (sub)program. nc
!           must not be too small (see c). unchanged on exit.
!   c     : real array of dimension at least (nest*idim).
!           on succesful exit, this array will contain the coefficients
!           in the b-spline representation of the spline curve s(u),i.e.
!           the b-spline coefficients of the spline sj(u) will be given
!           in c(n*(j-1)+i),i=1,2,...,n-k-1 for j=1,2,...,idim.
!   fp    : real. unless ier = 10, fp contains the weighted sum of
!           squared residuals of the spline curve returned.
!   wrk   : real array of dimension at least m*(k+1)+nest*(6+idim+3*k).
!           used as working space. if the computation mode iopt=1 is
!           used, the values wrk(1),...,wrk(n) should be left unchanged
!           between subsequent calls.
!   lwrk  : integer. on entry,lwrk must specify the actual dimension of
!           the array wrk as declared in the calling (sub)program. lwrk
!           must not be too small (see wrk). unchanged on exit.
!   iwrk  : integer array of dimension at least (nest).
!           used as working space. if the computation mode iopt=1 is
!           used,the values iwrk(1),...,iwrk(n) should be left unchanged
!           between subsequent calls.
!   ier   : integer. unless the routine detects an error, ier contains a
!           non-positive value on exit, i.e.
!    ier=0  : normal return. the curve returned has a residual sum of
!             squares fp such that abs(fp-s)/s <= tol with tol a relat-
!             ive tolerance set to 0.001 by the program.
!    ier=-1 : normal return. the curve returned is an interpolating
!             spline curve (fp=0).
!    ier=-2 : normal return. the curve returned is the weighted least-
!             squares polynomial curve of degree k.in this extreme case
!             fp gives the upper bound fp0 for the smoothing factor s.
!    ier=1  : error. the required storage space exceeds the available
!             storage space, as specified by the parameter nest.
!             probably causes : nest too small. if nest is already
!             large (say nest > m/2), it may also indicate that s is
!             too small
!             the approximation returned is the least-squares spline
!             curve according to the knots t(1),t(2),...,t(n). (n=nest)
!             the parameter fp gives the corresponding weighted sum of
!             squared residuals (fp>s).
!    ier=2  : error. a theoretically impossible result was found during
!             the iteration proces for finding a smoothing spline curve
!             with fp = s. probably causes : s too small.
!             there is an approximation returned but the corresponding
!             weighted sum of squared residuals does not satisfy the
!             condition abs(fp-s)/s < tol.
!    ier=3  : error. the maximal number of iterations maxit (set to 20
!             by the program) allowed for finding a smoothing curve
!             with fp=s has been reached. probably causes : s too small
!             there is an approximation returned but the corresponding
!             weighted sum of squared residuals does not satisfy the
!             condition abs(fp-s)/s < tol.
!    ier=10 : error. on entry, the input data are controlled on validity
!             the following restrictions must be satisfied.
!             -1<=iopt<=1, 1<=k<=5, m>k, nest>2*k+2, w(i)>0,i=1,2,...,m
!             0<=ipar<=1, 0<idim<=10, lwrk>=(k+1)*m+nest*(6+idim+3*k),
!             nc>=nest*idim
!             if ipar=0: sum j=1,idim (x(idim*i+j)-x(idim*(i-1)+j))**2>0
!                        i=1,2,...,m-1.
!             if ipar=1: ub<=u(1)<u(2)<...<u(m)<=ue
!             if iopt=-1: 2*k+2<=n<=min(nest,m+k+1)
!                         ub<t(k+2)<t(k+3)<...<t(n-k-1)<ue
!                            (ub=0 and ue=1 in case ipar=0)
!                       the schoenberg-whitney conditions, i.e. there
!                       must be a subset of data points uu(j) such that
!                         t(j) < uu(j) < t(j+k+1), j=1,2,...,n-k-1
!             if iopt>=0: s>=0
!                         if s=0 : nest >= m+k+1
!             if one of these conditions is found to be violated,control
!             is immediately repassed to the calling program. in that
!             case there is no approximation returned.
!
!  further comments:
!   by means of the parameter s, the user can control the tradeoff
!   between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit of the approximation.
!   if s is too large, the curve will be too smooth and signal will be
!   lost ; if s is too small the curve will pick up too much noise. in
!   the extreme cases the program will return an interpolating curve if
!   s=0 and the least-squares polynomial curve of degree k if s is
!   very large. between these extremes, a properly chosen s will result
!   in a good compromise between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit.
!   to decide whether an approximation, corresponding to a certain s is
!   satisfactory the user is highly recommended to inspect the fits
!   graphically.
!   recommended values for s depend on the weights w(i). if these are
!   taken as 1/d(i) with d(i) an estimate of the standard deviation of
!   x(i), a good s-value should be found in the range (m-sqrt(2*m),m+
!   sqrt(2*m)). if nothing is known about the statistical error in x(i)
!   each w(i) can be set equal to one and s determined by trial and
!   error, taking account of the comments above. the best is then to
!   start with a very large value of s ( to determine the least-squares
!   polynomial curve and the upper bound fp0 for s) and then to
!   progressively decrease the value of s ( say by a factor 10 in the
!   beginning, i.e. s=fp0/10, fp0/100,...and more carefully as the
!   approximating curve shows more detail) to obtain closer fits.
!   to economize the search for a good s-value the program provides with
!   different modes of computation. at the first call of the routine, or
!   whenever he wants to restart with the initial set of knots the user
!   must set iopt=0.
!   if iopt=1 the program will continue with the set of knots found at
!   the last call of the routine. this will save a lot of computation
!   time if parcur is called repeatedly for different values of s.
!   the number of knots of the spline returned and their location will
!   depend on the value of s and on the complexity of the shape of the
!   curve underlying the data. but, if the computation mode iopt=1 is
!   used, the knots returned may also depend on the s-values at previous
!   calls (if these were smaller). therefore, if after a number of
!   trials with different s-values and iopt=1, the user can finally
!   accept a fit as satisfactory, it may be worthwhile for him to call
!   parcur once more with the selected value for s but now with iopt=0.
!   indeed, parcur may then return an approximation of the same quality
!   of fit but with fewer knots and therefore better if data reduction
!   is also an important objective for the user.
!
!   the form of the approximating curve can strongly be affected by
!   the choice of the parameter values u(i). if there is no physical
!   reason for choosing a particular parameter u, often good results
!   will be obtained with the choice of parcur (in case ipar=0), i.e.
!        v(1)=0, v(i)=v(i-1)+q(i), i=2,...,m, u(i)=v(i)/v(m), i=1,..,m
!   where
!        q(i)= sqrt(sum j=1,idim (xj(i)-xj(i-1))**2 )
!   other possibilities for q(i) are
!        q(i)= sum j=1,idim (xj(i)-xj(i-1))**2
!        q(i)= sum j=1,idim abs(xj(i)-xj(i-1))
!        q(i)= max j=1,idim abs(xj(i)-xj(i-1))
!        q(i)= 1
