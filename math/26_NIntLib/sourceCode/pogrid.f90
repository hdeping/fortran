!  subroutine pogrid fits a function f(x,y) to a set of data points
!  z(i,j) given at the nodes (x,y)=(u(i)*cos(v(j)),u(i)*sin(v(j))),
!  i=1,...,mu ; j=1,...,mv , of a radius-angle grid over a disc
!    x ** 2  +  y ** 2  <=  r ** 2 .
!
!  this approximation problem is reduced to the determination of a
!  bicubic spline s(u,v) smoothing the data (u(i),v(j),z(i,j)) on the
!  rectangle 0<=u<=r, v(1)<=v<=v(1)+2*pi
!  in order to have continuous partial derivatives
!              i+j
!             d   f(0,0)
!    g(i,j) = ----------
!                i   j
!              dx  dy
!
!  s(u,v)=f(x,y) must satisfy the following conditions
!
!    (1) s(0,v) = g(0,0)   v(1)<=v<= v(1)+2*pi
!
!        d s(0,v)
!    (2) -------- = cos(v)*g(1,0)+sin(v)*g(0,1)  v(1)<=v<= v(1)+2*pi
!        d u
!
!  moreover, s(u,v) must be periodic in the variable v, i.e.
!
!         j            j
!        d s(u,vb)   d s(u,ve)
!    (3) ---------- = ---------   0 <=u<= r, j=0,1,2 , vb=v(1),
!           j            j                             ve=vb+2*pi
!        d v          d v
!
!  the number of knots of s(u,v) and their position tu(i),i=1,2,...,nu;
!  tv(j),j=1,2,...,nv, is chosen automatically by the routine. the
!  smoothness of s(u,v) is achieved by minimalizing the discontinuity
!  jumps of the derivatives of the spline at the knots. the amount of
!  smoothness of s(u,v) is determined by the condition that
!  fp=sumi=1,mu(sumj=1,mv((z(i,j)-s(u(i),v(j)))**2))+(z0-g(0,0))**2<=s,
!  with s a given non-negative constant.
!  the fit s(u,v) is given in its b-spline representation and can be
!  evaluated by means of routine bispev. f(x,y) = s(u,v) can also be
!  evaluated by means of function program evapol.

!   ier=-2 : normal return. the spline returned is the least-squares
!            constrained polynomial. in this extreme case fp gives the

!   ier=1  : error. the required storage space exceeds the available
!            storage space, as specified by the parameters nuest and
!            nvest.
!            probably causes : nuest or nvest too small. if these param-
!            eters are already large, it may also indicate that s is
!            too small
!            the approximation returned is the least-squares spline
!            according to the current set of knots. the parameter fp
!            gives the corresponding sum of squared residuals (fp>s).
!   ier=2  : error. a theoretically impossible result was found during

!            there is an approximation returned but the corresponding
!            sum of squared residuals does not satisfy the condition
!            abs(fp-s)/s < tol.
!   ier=3  : error. the maximal number of iterations maxit (set to 20
!            by the program) allowed for finding a smoothing spline

!            the following restrictions must be satisfied.

!            case there is no approximation returned.
!
! further comments:
!   pogrid does not allow individual weighting of the data-values.
!   so, if these were determined to widely different accuracies, then
!   perhaps the general data set routine polar should rather be used
!   in spite of efficiency.
!   by means of the parameter s, the user can control the tradeoff
!   between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit of the approximation.
!   if s is too large, the spline will be too smooth and signal will be
!   lost ; if s is too small the spline will pick up too much noise. in
!   the extreme cases the program will return an interpolating spline if
!   s=0 and the constrained least-squares polynomial(degrees 3,0)if s is
!   very large. between these extremes, a properly chosen s will result
!   in a good compromise between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit.
!   to decide whether an approximation, corresponding to a certain s is
!   satisfactory the user is highly recommended to inspect the fits
!   graphically.
!   recommended values for s depend on the accuracy of the data values.
!   if the user has an idea of the statistical errors on the data, he
!   can also find a proper estimate for s. for, by assuming that, if he
!   specifies the right s, pogrid will return a spline s(u,v) which
!   exactly reproduces the function underlying the data he can evaluate
!   the sum((z(i,j)-s(u(i),v(j)))**2) to find a good estimate for this s
!   for example, if he knows that the statistical errors on his z(i,j)-
!   values is not greater than 0.1, he may expect that a good s should
!   have a value not larger than mu*mv*(0.1)**2.
!   if nothing is known about the statistical error in z(i,j), s must
!   be determined by trial and error, taking account of the comments
!   above. the best is then to start with a very large value of s (to
!   determine the least-squares polynomial and the corresponding upper
!   bound fp0 for s) and then to progressively decrease the value of s
!   ( say by a factor 10 in the beginning, i.e. s=fp0/10,fp0/100,...
!   and more carefully as the approximation shows more detail) to
!   obtain closer fits.
!   to economize the search for a good s-value the program provides with
!   different modes of computation. at the first call of the routine, or
!   whenever he wants to restart with the initial set of knots the user
!   must set iopt(1)=0.
!   if iopt(1) = 1 the program will continue with the knots found at
!   the last call of the routine. this will save a lot of computation
!   time if pogrid is called repeatedly for different values of s.
!   the number of knots of the spline returned and their location will
!   depend on the value of s and on the complexity of the shape of the
!   function underlying the data. if the computation mode iopt(1) = 1
!   is used, the knots returned may also depend on the s-values at
!   previous calls (if these were smaller). therefore, if after a number
!   of trials with different s-values and iopt(1)=1,the user can finally
!   accept a fit as satisfactory, it may be worthwhile for him to call
!   pogrid once more with the chosen value for s but now with iopt(1)=0.
!   indeed, pogrid may then return an approximation of the same quality
!   of fit but with fewer knots and therefore better if data reduction
!   is also an important objective for the user.
!   the number of knots may also depend on the upper bounds nuest and
!   nvest. indeed, if at a certain stage in pogrid the number of knots
!   in one direction (say nu) has reached the value of its upper bound
!   (nuest), then from that moment on all subsequent knots are added
!   in the other (v) direction. this may indicate that the value of
!   nuest is too small. on the other hand, it gives the user the option
!   of limiting the number of knots the routine locates in any direction
!   for example, by setting nuest=8 (the lowest allowable value for
!   nuest), the user can indicate that he wants an approximation which
!   is a simple cubic polynomial in the variable u.
